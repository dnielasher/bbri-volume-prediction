# BBRI Stock Volume Prediction using Deep Stacked Bi-LSTM 📈

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on forecasting the daily trading volume of **Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI)** stock using Deep Learning. Specifically, I implemented a **Deep Stacked Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)** architecture to handle the non-linear and stochastic nature of volume data.

**Model Performance:**
* **R2 Score:** 0.4360
* **MAE:** 56,554,994
* **RMSE:** 85,729,561

**Key Technologies:**
* Python & TensorFlow/Keras
* Time-Series Forecasting (Windowing)
* Deep Learning (Bi-LSTM Layers)
